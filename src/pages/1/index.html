    <p class="story">Imagine the year 2050. You, Erik Z is a part of one of the biggest hacker group and you and your friend are making the best of they life but entering places where they weren’t supposed to enter just for fun or to show the world how bad can people be and try to expose the “true face” of the most influential and richest people in the world.
    <p class="story">You and your friends are anonymous and the way that you hack is very different from when you started in high school. In the year 2021, you hacked a computer using a program but stayed in one place and the only thing that you see while hacking a huge terminal. Now, you “enter” physically the computer by using the Metaverse and the internet. You take advantage of the Metaverse and that everyone and everything is connected to the network and use that to your advantage. You can enter other people's brains and see their memories and see what they are thinking. Of course, only you and your group of hacker friends know about that, even the company that created the Metaverse doesn't know about that.</p>    
    <p class="story">-Cmon, Jeff, hurry up or the brain gate is gonna close before you exit the brain. - Hugo said in a hurry.</p>
    <p class="story">-Chill bro, you know that I’m very fast and nothing can catch me. - said Jeff with pride of existing the brain in the last second.</p>
    <p class="story">-You need to be more careful Jeff. No one knows what happens when you don’t leave the brain after the user turns off the Metaverse in their head and the brain door closes. - said Ben, the leader of the group.</p>
    <p class="story">-I know, I know… The important part is that we got the information that we needed, gonna put it on the server and send it to our buyer.</p>
    <p class="story">-Please. I reallyyyyy wanted to eat something hot and fresh this week. - said Eza.</p>
    <p class="story">-Only in your dreams. Even in the Metaverse hot and fresh “food” is expensive af.</p>
    <p class="story">-I know… but I miss the fresh salad with rice and meat or fish. I also miss the sea, the trees, the animals, the fresh and natural water and not this thing.</p>
    <p class="story">-Me too, but what can you do. Since the overpopulation started to rise on an astronomical scale everything is very scaso. At least be thankful that you have food, water and a hot place to sleep, some people don't. Well, I'm gonna play some COD on my ps10 and sleep a bit.</p>
    <p class="story">-Cya. - said everyone while Eza leaves.</p>
